Summary :
*So far only find 2 NoSQL that support installation in RPi 3 (32 bit) => RavenDB and CouchDB
*prefer RavenDB than CouchDB because :
	- no significance difference in read time 
	- much faster write time 
	- easier to query (using LinQ)
	- If disk usage is not a concern (RavenDB use much more disk than CouchDB)

===========COUCHDB============= 
>>NOTE ON COUCHDB
-for writing using MyCouch Driver 
-for querying using couchDB query + HTTP req/res manually 
because MyCouch documentation is not clear compare to couchDB documentation(especially for querying)
-CouchDB Implementation Language = Erlang
-Querying using MapReduce function. see here : https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/ddocs/views/nosql.html#mapreduce-function
-Still not yet find convenient query solution to get sensor data only from http response (it includes metadata)

========OTHER NoSQL=========

>> RethinkDB 
https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/6449
"RethinkDB is impossible to use on a Raspberry Pi 3"

>> MongoDB
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51811140/how-to-install-mongodb-on-windows-7-32-bit
"Changed in version 3.4: MongoDB no longer supports 32-bit x86 platforms."
.Net driver for mongoDB is not support older version of MongoDB

>>CocroachDB
https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/32147#issuecomment-438055230
"We don't currently support 32-bit architectures"

>>ArangoDB,Cassandra, OrientDB
so far, there is no clear evidence these DB can be installed in Raspberry 3 (32 bit)
